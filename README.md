### üòÑ Hello, this is my Front-End Bootcamp Landing Page.

![front-end-bootcamp-screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79328687/168452777-a710a278-6fe6-4c03-ba3d-0d911e57bb52.png)

ü§ñ It was built using **Bootstrap 5**. Every Component was copied from Bootstrap Docs and made a few customizations.

‚≠êIt also works with grid structure system from **Bootstrap**, which makes the responsive part a lot easier. You could mix them with Media Queries and get all the content responding pretty well to every screen size.

### Why Bootstrap?

1. It gives you time <br>
**Bootstrap** has all those pre-made components which will save you a **great amount of time** when coding your projects. 

2. It maintains wide browser compatibility.
3. Easy to work with.
4. It's not bad for design <br>
You can customize pretty much everything from **Bootstrap**. You are not limited to the Bootstrap theme style. 
5. It maintains wide browser compatibility.
6. It offers consistent design by using re-usable components.

### Mapbox

The project also includes an API by [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
Which will help you display a map in your website with just a little bit of code.
